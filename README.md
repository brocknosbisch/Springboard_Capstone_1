Probability of Defaulting
By Brock Nosbisch 

What is the problem you want to solve? 
The problem I am trying to solve is to predict the probability of someone defaulting on payment (>90 days late). I am going to emphasize on several algorithms and review the performance and strengths and weaknesses of each.

Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client do or decide based on your analysis that they wouldnâ€™t have done otherwise? 
My client is any bank, credit union, etc. that gives loans to individuals. Predicting whether someone will default on their loan is key to the company deciding on whether to give that loan or to raise the interest rate. 
This model will take an certain inputs (TBD) and output the probability that the person will be 90+ days late making a payment in the next 1 year? 2 years?
